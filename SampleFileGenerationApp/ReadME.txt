Notes:
Program loads words dictionary that would be used to generate entries and generate random entries.

Things that could be improved:
- reading arguments is not fully implemented (due to time constraints) 
- Configuration file can be added (instead of passing values)
- there is an option to multiply a file but there is no switch for it (it needs to be mannualy changed in the code right now)
